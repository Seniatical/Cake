Basic
*****
Basic classes are the bases of all classes and hold the definitions which make up other classes,
this helps maintain constistancy within the cake library. 
We don't recomend you use these classes when making your own but instead implement them from the ``Core`` region.

ABC's
=====
ABCs in the cake library contain the derivatives of all the standard cake classes.
